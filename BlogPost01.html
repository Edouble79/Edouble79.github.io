	<h1>My Introduction and Journey into The Tech Field</h1>
	<div>Monday, September 13th 2021</div>
	<p>My journey into Tech/Coding began when I was laid off from Chicago Public Schools as a Teacher of College & Career.  A friend of mine named Gino heard of what happned to me and reached out to me to see if I would be interested in starting a starting a career in Coding/Tech Field</p>

	<p>I remember Gino saying "Ok, at first you will feel overwhelmed withe language.  But continue and do not give up.  I will be here to assist you if you need me.  First begin with Codecademy."</p>

	<p>The first week of Codecademy was exactly that, overwhelming.  As a former Teacher with a Bacholors in Education, I did not understand the language.  I continued however to see how far I could go.  After taking my time and three weeks later I was so proud of myself for completing the Codecademy program.</p>

	<p>Codecademy was a great introduction to HTML.  I learned about the anatomy of HTML. I was not aware of openning & closing tags.  There are structues in place when working with HTML such as The Body, Headings, DIVS, and Attributes.</p>

	<p>In HTML I learned how to link to other web pages, adding tables, rows, table headings, styling with CSS, inputting forms, adding labels, passwords, input numbers, range input, and check box input.</p>
