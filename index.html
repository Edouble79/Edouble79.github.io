	<h2>Hello Eveyone
		<p>	My name is Erik Arroyo I am a former Chicago Public School teacher who has made a career change into the tech field and I am excited to learn and grow just as my former students have.  I beleive in helping and assisting those in need, and becoming a productive member of society.  I will be transfering my skills from teaching into tech field and would like to collaborate with others.</p>
